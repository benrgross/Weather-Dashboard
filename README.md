## Description

The Weather Dashboard website is designed to give you up to date weather forecasting for a chosen city. By typing in the city of choice, the dashboard will load the current weather information for that city. The dashboard will display the weather conditions , temperature, humidity, wind speed and the UV index with a dynamic display that indicates the severeness of the UV index via color code. The user also receives a an easy to view 5 day weather forecast with conditions, temperature and humidity.

The app utilizes the Open Weather API and three separate endpoints. The api allows the user to obtain: current weather, the 5 day forecast and UV indexes. jQuery Ajax calls were deployed to navigate the response form the API. jQuery was also used to dynamically build and update displays on the screen. Local storage was used to store the previous cities the user searched and Bootstrap CSS framework was implemented to achieve an elegant layout.
