By typing in the city of choice, the dashboard will load the current weather information for that city, with a display of weather conditions - via and icon -, temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index with a dynamic that display that indicated the severeness of the UV index with a color code. The user also receives a an easy to view 5 day weather forecast with conditions, temperature and humidity.

The app utilizes the Open Weather API with three different endpoints, in order to obtain: current weather, the 5 day forecast and UV indexes. jQuery Ajax calls were deployed to navigate the response form the API and jQuery was use to dynamically build and update displays on the screen. Local storage was used to store the previous cities the user searched and Bootstrap CSS framework was implemented to achieve an elegant layout.
